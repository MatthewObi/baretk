BARETK (Binary Analysis and Reverse Engineering Tool Kit) is a work-in-progress suite of tools that will allow the user to examine and analyze binary files.

## Planned features

* The ability to read information from common executable formats such as ELF and PE.
* The ability to disassemble machine code from executables and binary files.
* The ability to generate appoximate pseudo C code from compiled machine code in executables.
* The ability to search for specific binary sequences inside binaries or executables.
* The ability to run executable files in a sandboxed environment via an interpreter or JIT recompilation.
